Data correctness & API reliability

“Fix the stuck AQI (85/88) bug so each location shows distinct, live values from real APIs (no caching/stale state).”

“No mock data anywhere—only live responses from OpenAQ, Open-Meteo, NASA layers, and optional WAQI; show a clear empty-state if a provider is down.”

“Add a source attribution badge (OpenAQ / Open-Meteo / NASA) near each widget so users know which API powered the value.”

“Implement health of APIs banner (green/amber/red) reflecting last successful fetch and latency.”

AI prediction & weekly report

“Fuse OpenAQ + Open-Meteo + NASA (AOD/fires) via AI ensemble to produce final hyperlocal AQI & pollutant forecasts with confidence bands.”

“Generate a 7-day detailed AI report (AQI, PM2.5/PM10/NO₂/O₃) with daily summaries and actionable health guidance (WHO/CPCB).”

“Use chunked AI I/O: send features in chunks to the model and stream stitched results + explanations back to the UI.”

“Show model diagnostics (MAE/MAPE, residual plot) so users see forecast quality over time.”

Search & location (fix critical search issue)

“Replace/augment search with place → lat/lon geocoding (Open-Meteo Geocoding or Nominatim), with debounced suggestions and keyboard navigation.”

“Ensure search actually switches location: on select, refresh all panels/graphs/forecast and update URL state (shareable).”

“Add recent searches & saved places for one-tap recall.”

Forecast freshness

“Fix forecast not changing: tie forecast queries strictly to current lat/lon + timezone; bust caches and visibly show last updated time.”

“Add location compare (current vs another town) to prove values differ and updates work.”

UI/UX polish (professional, distinct, not a generic weather site)

“Rename everywhere to AeroAware with professional copy and concise micro-copy for each card.”

“Redesign the homepage dashboard: clear hero (location + AQI gauge), key pollutant cards, mini-forecast strip, and map preview—no component clipping.”

“Make API output circle smaller or switch to a compact gauge so top components never get cut.”

“Adopt a vibrant yet professional theme (consistent colors, spacing, shadows, overlays) with tasteful micro-animations on load/hover.”

“Improve legibility hierarchy: larger headline values, readable units, secondary labels, and accessible color contrast.”

“Add a prominent search bar in the header and a ‘Detect location’ button.”

Graphs & maps (make data truly visible)

“Use interactive charts (hover tooltips, series toggles, zoom/pan, download PNG/CSV) so data is clearly visible.”

“Display forecast bands (p50 ± p90) and annotate events (fires, dust) when AI detects anomalies.”

“Add a heatmap + station pins with a legend and layer toggles (AQI heatmap / AOD / fires).”

“Show unit switches (µg/m³ vs AQI) and WHO/CPCB breakpoint toggles.”

Mobile excellence

“Make mobile-first: responsive cards, stacked layout, big tap targets, sticky search/action bar, and buttery scroll performance.”

“Optimize skeleton loaders and perceived speed for slow networks.”

Performance & reliability

“Add retry + backoff and graceful fallbacks per provider, with inline error states (not console-only).”

“Show a status toast when data refresh completes or fails.”

“Prevent stale UI: invalidate caches on location change and periodic refresh.”

Alerts & advanced analytics

“Enable threshold alerts (e.g., AQI ≥ ‘Poor’, PM2.5 > N) with optional push; summarize last 7 days of alerts.”

“Add advanced analytics: pollutant contribution chart, trend slope, daily exposure score, and top 5 worst hours this week.”

“Include an ‘AI Insight’ chip on charts that explains spikes/dips in plain language.”

Content & branding quality

“Audit all text for professional tone; tighten headings, remove filler, add brief health recommendations per category.”

“Add onboarding hints (3 short tooltips) the first time a user lands.”
