Brief: AI-Powered Air Quality Visualizer & 72-Hour Predictor
Objective

Deliver hyperlocal, real-time air quality for small towns and rural areas.

Provide clear 24–72 hour predictions of AQI and key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃), including uncertainty ranges.

Show historical trends and interactive heatmaps.

Give plain-language health recommendations aligned with WHO and Indian (CPCB) breakpoints.

Optional: alerts when thresholds are exceeded and context on likely sources (fires, traffic, industrial zones).

AI Prediction (must be “proper AI”)

Use a small time-series prediction model (served through a free API) to produce location-specific forecasts for the next 24–72 hours.

Inputs/Features: recent station readings (OpenAQ), weather forecasts (Open-Meteo), and satellite indicators (e.g., aerosol optical depth, fires).

Approach: start from open forecasts (baseline) and calibrate/adjust them with the AI model to make them hyperlocal; refresh as new data arrives.

Explanations: accompany forecasts with short AI-generated narratives (why it’s rising/falling, simple precautions).

Free / Free-Tier APIs to Use

Core data

OpenAQ — real-time & historical pollutant measurements (no key).

Open-Meteo Air Quality + Weather — pollutant and meteorology forecasts (no key).

Open-Meteo Geocoding (or Nominatim/OSM) — place → coordinates (no key).

Satellite/context layers

NASA GIBS — aerosol optical depth and other atmospheric layers (tiles).

NASA FIRMS — active fire data (for potential smoke impact).

Optional enrichments (still free)

Meteostat — historical weather context.

WAQI — alternative/fallback station data (free token).

Public endpoints from CPCB/IMD/ISRO when accessible.

AI services

Hugging Face Inference API (free tier) — host/call a lightweight time-series model to generate the actual numeric predictions and uncertainty.

OpenRouter API (free models tier) — generate health advice, alerts text, and human-readable summaries of trends/forecasts.

Hosting & Credentials

Host on Netlify (serverless).

All API credentials stored only as Netlify environment variables.

All external API calls go through Netlify serverless functions (never from the browser) to keep keys private.

Optional: schedule periodic refresh and threshold checks for push alerts using Netlify’s scheduled functions.

Constraints

Use only free APIs or free tiers.

Keep the experience professional and accessible; design/implementation choices are up to Replit.
